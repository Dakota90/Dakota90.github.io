Well I started out doing game design and I just felt like I wasn't getting anywhere I was doing the work but I just felt like every semester there was something new that I had to learn and I just feel like I wasn't getting close to my goal so my girlfriend is taking the classes to and She told me about it and that you always help people get classes or jobs with Apple and I have a huge Apple fan boy and so working with them or working for them would be a dream come true sense video game was in is still my passion I just again felt like I wasn't getting anywhere but I feel like I'm understanding coding I've even already made an app that Jess says hello what would you like me to do stuff like that and its really been fun an id love Continue and go down the coding road I think
